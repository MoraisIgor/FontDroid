![1] FontDroid
==============


Example
-------

The font can be set to a widget in various ways.

###### In XML

All supported widgets can be found in graphical layout tab.

![2]

You can drag and drop usually, the widgets have the following attributes.

```xml
<attr name="typefaceAssetPath" format="string" />
<attr name="typefaceFilePath" format="string" />
<attr name="typefaceCache" format="boolean" />
```

I think the attributes names are self explanatory, but let me say.

* `typefaceAssetPath` 
* `typefaceFilePath`
* `typefaceCache`
